# pop_music_gnb_e29
This is my final project for Python for Data Science (CSCI E-29) at Harvard Extension School, Spring 2018.  I use a Gaussian Naive Bayes machine learning classifier in Python to try predicting which decade a song was released, based on it's harmonic and timbre features.

The dataset used was from an article by Matthias Mauch et al., "The evolution of popular music: USA 1960-2010".  The graph shown at 1:00 is from the same article.
